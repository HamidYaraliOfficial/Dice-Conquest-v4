# Dice Conquest — Conquer the World, One Roll at a Time

## Project Introduction
An original offline, turn-based dice strategy game for the browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari). No backend required.

## Game Overview
A world map of 50 territories (circles on stylised continents, linked by land and sea routes) forms a graph. Each territory has an owner and soldiers (max 8). 2–8 players (humans and/or AI) fight until one remains.

## Game Rules
1. Select your territory with at least 2 soldiers. 2. Select an adjacent enemy territory. 3. End your turn to receive reinforcements. 4. The last player alive wins.

## Dice Battle Mechanics
Each side rolls exactly one D6 per soldier in its territory. The attacker wins only if its total is strictly greater (ties go to the defender). Afterwards the source territory keeps exactly 1 soldier. On victory all other attacking soldiers move into the conquered territory; on defeat they are lost. Dice results are decided in the engine before the animation plays.

## Territory Conquest
Only adjacent enemy territories can be attacked. Ownership changes with an animated colour transition. After you end your turn you receive dice equal to half of your frontier (links to enemy territories, rounded up, minimum 1) and place them freely on any of your territories below 8 soldiers.

## Player and AI System
Modes: Single Player, AI Battle (0 humans), Local Multiplayer (hot-seat), Quick Match. AI levels: Easy, Normal (best win probability), Hard (win probability plus map position, leader targeting, eliminations, exposure).

## Features
World map graph, online multiplayer (room code), auto-play, manual reinforcement placement, continent bonuses, alliances (team mode and diplomacy with AI), ambient music, keyboard shortcuts, custom player names and colors for every player, color-blind owner numbers, seeded setup, zoom and pan, animated dice battles, attack line effect, Battle History, Victory screen with stats, autosave and Continue, versioned and validated save, sound, game speed, Reduce Motion support, responsive layout for phones, tablets and desktops with pinch-zoom and fullscreen, dice with real pips, turn banners, English / فارسی (RTL) / 简体中文.

## Screenshots
Run the game locally and take your own screenshots; none are bundled to avoid depicting unimplemented features.

## Project Structure
`src/engine.js` (dice, battle, reinforcement, win rules) · `src/ai.js` · `src/main.js` (UI, map, save) · `src/i18n/*.json` · `tests/engine.test.js` · `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

## Installation
```
npm install
```
## Running Locally
```
npm run dev
```
## Build
```
npm run build
```
## Testing
```
npm run test
```
## GitHub Pages Deployment
Push to `main`, then in Settings → Pages choose Source: GitHub Actions. The workflow builds with the correct base path (`/<repo-name>/`).

## Language Support
English, Persian (RTL), Simplified Chinese. Translations live in `src/i18n/*.json`; the choice is stored in LocalStorage.

## Roadmap
React + TypeScript migration, more maps, online multiplayer, UI component tests.
